Create weapons
Create path for movement
Create enemies
Let the player fire weapon
Create UI for health
Create barriers
Add lots of cool little details
Add a method in player controller for checking if the mouse is over UI 
	(the best way might be to create a seperate class which observes the mouse position and all ui elements)
	also, supposedly this call will only happen if the mouse is over UI. If so, then we can easily create an IsOverUI property
	if (EventSystem.current.IsPointerOverGameObject()) { // UI elements getting the hit/hover }
